# MiniRT: Introduction to Raytracing

**MiniRT** is a lightweight raytracer developed as part of the 42 curriculum. It introduces the core principles of raytracing—a powerful technique for generating realistic lighting and shadows in 3D scenes. This project offers hands-on experience with 3D math, geometric transformations, lighting models, and low-level graphics.

## 🔍 Features

- **Scene Parsing**: Parses and validates `.rt` files to configure 3D scenes.
- **Geometric Objects**: Supports rendering spheres, planes, and cylinders.
- **Lighting System**: Implements ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting using the Phong reflection model.
- **Configurable Camera**: Field of view and direction can be customized.
- **Transformations**: Translate, rotate, and scale objects.
- **Rendering Engine**: Casts rays and computes intersections to generate a 2D image.
- **MiniLibX Integration**: Displays rendered images using the MiniLibX graphics library.

## 📚 How It Works

1. **Scene Parsing**: Reads `.rt` files to configure the scene.
2. **Ray Casting**: Rays are projected from the camera through each pixel.
3. **Intersection Detection**: Calculates intersections with objects.
4. **Lighting Computation**: Applies the Phong model for realistic shading.
5. **Image Rendering**: Displays the final image using MiniLibX.
